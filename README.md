# Four-Stroke Engine Animation

This project renders a side-view, four-stroke internal combustion engine using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases piston motion, valve timing, combustion, and exhaust particles in a playful, visually rich demo.

## Why It Exists

- Built purely for fun as a weekend tinkering project.
- Shared so anyone can learn from it, remix it, or bolt it into their own experiments.
- Free for personal or non-commercial use in any form.
- If you do happen to ship it in something commercial, just cut me in.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3. Use the on-page controls to tweak speed, pause/resume, and walk through the stroke cycle.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – layout, controls, and canvas host element.
- `styles.css` – presentation for the app shell and control panel.
- `engine.js` – animation loop, kinematics, and particle effects.

Feedback and pull requests are always welcome. Have fun exploring the cycle!
